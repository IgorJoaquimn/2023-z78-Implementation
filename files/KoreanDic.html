      &nbsp;Copyright (C) 2000&nbsp; Free Software Foundation, Inc. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA&nbsp; 02111-1307&nbsp; USA <br>&nbsp;Everyone
      is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies <br>&nbsp;of this
      license document, but changing it is not allowed. <br>&nbsp;
    </p>
<p>
      0. PREAMBLE
    </p>
<p>
      The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other <br>written
      document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone <br>the
      effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without <br>modifying
      it, either commercially or noncommercially.&nbsp; Secondarily, <br>this
      License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get <br>credit
      for their work, while not being considered responsible for <br>modifications
      made by others.
    </p>
<p>
      This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative <br>works
      of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.&nbsp; It <br>complements
      the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft <br>license designed
      for free software.
    </p>
<p>
      We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
      <br>software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
      <br>program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
      <br>software does.&nbsp; But this License is not limited to software
      manuals; <br>it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject
      matter or <br>whether it is published as a printed book.&nbsp; We
      recommend this License <br>principally for works whose purpose is
      instruction or reference. <br>&nbsp;
    </p>
<p>
      1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS
    </p>
<p>
      This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a <br>notice
      placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed <br>under the
      terms of this License.&nbsp; The "Document", below, refers to any <br>such
      manual or work.&nbsp; Any member of the public is a licensee, and is <br>addressed
      as "you".
    </p>
<p>
      A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the <br>Document
      or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with <br>modifications
      and/or translated into another language.
    </p>
<p>
      A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
      <br>the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
      <br>publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
      subject <br>(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
      directly <br>within that overall subject.&nbsp; (For example, if the
      Document is in part a <br>textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section
      may not explain any <br>mathematics.)&nbsp; The relationship could be a
      matter of historical <br>connection with the subject or with related
      matters, or of legal, <br>commercial, philosophical, ethical or political
      position regarding <br>them.
    </p>
<p>
      The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles <br>are
      designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice <br>that
      says that the Document is released under this License.
    </p>
<p>
      The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
      <br>as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says
      that <br>the Document is released under this License.
    </p>
<p>
      A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, <br>represented
      in a format whose specification is available to the <br>general public,
      whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and <br>straightforwardly
      with generic text editors or (for images composed of <br>pixels) generic
      paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available <br>drawing
      editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or <br>for
      automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input <br>to
      text formatters.&nbsp; A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file <br>format
      whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage <br>subsequent
      modification by readers is not Transparent.&nbsp; A copy that is <br>not
      "Transparent" is called "Opaque".
    </p>
<p>
      Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain <br>ASCII
      without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML <br>or XML
      using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple <br>HTML
      designed for human modification.&nbsp; Opaque formats include <br>PostScript,
      PDF, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only <br>by
      proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or <br>processing
      tools are not generally available, and the <br>machine-generated HTML
      produced by some word processors for output <br>purposes only.
    </p>
<p>
      The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, <br>plus
      such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material <br>this
      License requires to appear in the title page.&nbsp; For works in <br>formats
      which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means <br>the text
      near the most prominent appearance of the work's title, <br>preceding the
      beginning of the body of the text. <br>&nbsp;
    </p>
<p>
      2. VERBATIM COPYING
    </p>
<p>
      You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either <br>commercially
      or noncommercially, provided that this License, the <br>copyright
      notices, and the license notice saying this License applies <br>to the
      Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other <br>conditions
      whatsoever to those of this License.&nbsp; You may not use <br>technical
      measures to obstruct or control the reading or further <br>copying of the
      copies you make or distribute.&nbsp; However, you may accept <br>compensation
      in exchange for copies.&nbsp; If you distribute a large enough <br>number
      of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
    </p>
<p>
      You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
      <br>you may publicly display copies. <br>&nbsp;
    </p>
<p>
      3. COPYING IN QUANTITY
    </p>
<p>
      If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100,
      <br>and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
      enclose <br>the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
      these Cover <br>Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
      Back-Cover Texts on <br>the back cover.&nbsp; Both covers must also
      clearly and legibly identify <br>you as the publisher of these copies.&nbsp;
      The front cover must present <br>the full title with all words of the
      title equally prominent and <br>visible.&nbsp; You may add other material
      on the covers in addition. <br>Copying with changes limited to the
      covers, as long as they preserve <br>the title of the Document and
      satisfy these conditions, can be treated <br>as verbatim copying in other
      respects.
    </p>
<p>
      If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit <br>legibly,
      you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit <br>reasonably) on
      the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent <br>pages.
    </p>
<p>
      If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering <br>more
      than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent <br>copy
      along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy <br>a
      publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete <br>Transparent
      copy of the Document, free of added material, which the <br>general
      network-using public has access to download anonymously at no <br>charge
      using public-standard network protocols.&nbsp; If you use the latter <br>option,
      you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin <br>distribution
      of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this <br>Transparent copy
      will remain thus accessible at the stated location <br>until at least one
      year after the last time you distribute an Opaque <br>copy (directly or
      through your agents or retailers) of that edition to <br>the public.
    </p>
<p>
      It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
      <br>Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to
      give <br>them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
      Document. <br>&nbsp;
    </p>
<p>
      4. MODIFICATIONS
    </p>
<p>
      You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under <br>the
      conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release <br>the
      Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified <br>Version
      filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution <br>and
      modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy <br>of
      it.&nbsp; In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:
    </p>
<p>
      A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
      <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; from that of the Document, and from those of previous
      versions <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; (which should, if there were any, be listed in
      the History section <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; of the Document).&nbsp; You may use
      the same title as a previous version <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; if the original
      publisher of that version gives permission. <br>B. List on the Title
      Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
      responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Document (all of its principal authors, if it has less than five). <br>C.
      State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Modified Version, as the publisher. <br>D. Preserve all the copyright
      notices of the Document. <br>E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for
      your modifications <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; adjacent to the other copyright
      notices. <br>F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a
      license notice <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; giving the public permission to use the
      Modified Version under the <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; terms of this License, in the
      form shown in the Addendum below. <br>G. Preserve in that license notice
      the full lists of Invariant Sections <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; and required Cover
      Texts given in the Document's license notice. <br>H. Include an unaltered
      copy of this License. <br>I. Preserve the section entitled "History", and
      its title, and add to <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; it an item stating at least the
      title, year, new authors, and <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; publisher of the Modified
      Version as given on the Title Page.&nbsp; If <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; there is no
      section entitled "History" in the Document, create one <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
      stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
      given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Version as stated in the previous sentence. <br>J. Preserve the network
      location, if any, given in the Document for <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; public
      access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
      the network locations given in the Document for previous versions <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
      it was based on.&nbsp; These may be placed in the "History" section. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
      You may omit a network location for a work that was published at <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
      least four years before the Document itself, or if the original <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
      publisher of the version it refers to gives permission. <br>K. In any
      section entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications", <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
      preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all the <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
      substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
      and/or dedications given therein. <br>L. Preserve all the Invariant
      Sections of the Document, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; unaltered in their text and in
      their titles.&nbsp; Section numbers <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; or the equivalent
      are not considered part of the section titles. <br>M. Delete any section
      entitled "Endorsements".&nbsp; Such a section <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; may not be
      included in the Modified Version. <br>N. Do not retitle any existing
      section as "Endorsements" <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; or to conflict in title with
      any Invariant Section.
    </p>
<p>
      If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or <br>appendices
      that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material <br>copied
      from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all <br>of
      these sections as invariant.&nbsp; To do this, add their titles to the
      <br>list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
      <br>These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.
    </p>
<p>
      You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains <br>nothing
      but endorsements of your Modified Version by various <br>parties--for
      example, statements of peer review or that the text has <br>been approved
      by an organization as the authoritative definition of a <br>standard.
    </p>
<p>
      You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
      <br>passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the
      list <br>of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.&nbsp; Only one passage
      of <br>Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
      <br>through arrangements made by) any one entity.&nbsp; If the Document
      already <br>includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by
      you or <br>by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on
      behalf of, <br>you may not add another; but you may replace the old one,
      on explicit <br>permission from the previous publisher that added the old
      one.
    </p>
<p>
      The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
      <br>give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
      <br>imply endorsement of any Modified Version. <br>&nbsp;
    </p>
<p>
      5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS
    </p>
<p>
      You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
      <br>License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
      <br>versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
      <br>Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
      <br>list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
      <br>license notice.
    </p>
<p>
      The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and <br>multiple
      identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single <br>copy.&nbsp;
      If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but <br>different
      contents, make the title of each such section unique by <br>adding at the
      end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original <br>author or
      publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. <br>Make the
      same adjustment to the section titles in the list of <br>Invariant
      Sections in the license notice of the combined work.
    </p>
<p>
      In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled "History" <br>in
      the various original documents, forming one section entitled <br>"History";
      likewise combine any sections entitled "Acknowledgements", <br>and any
      sections entitled "Dedications".&nbsp; You must delete all sections <br>entitled
      "Endorsements." <br>&nbsp;
    </p>
<p>
      6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS
    </p>
<p>
      You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
      <br>released under this License, and replace the individual copies of
      this <br>License in the various documents with a single copy that is
      included in <br>the collection, provided that you follow the rules of
      this License for <br>verbatim copying of each of the documents in all
      other respects.
    </p>
<p>
      You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
      <br>it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of
      this <br>License into the extracted document, and follow this License in
      all <br>other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document. <br>&nbsp;
    </p>
<p>
      7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS
    </p>
<p>
      A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate <br>and
      independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or <br>distribution
      medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version <br>of the
      Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the <br>compilation.&nbsp;
      Such a compilation is called an "aggregate", and this <br>License does
      not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled <br>with the
      Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they <br>are not
      themselves derivative works of the Document.
    </p>
<p>
      If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these <br>copies
      of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter <br>of the
      entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on <br>covers
      that surround only the Document within the aggregate. <br>Otherwise they
      must appear on covers around the whole aggregate. <br>&nbsp;
    </p>
<p>
      8. TRANSLATION
    </p>
<p>
      Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may <br>distribute
      translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. <br>Replacing
      Invariant Sections with translations requires special <br>permission from
      their copyright holders, but you may include <br>translations of some or
      all Invariant Sections in addition to the <br>original versions of these
      Invariant Sections.&nbsp; You may include a <br>translation of this
      License provided that you also include the <br>original English version
      of this License.&nbsp; In case of a disagreement <br>between the
      translation and the original English version of this <br>License, the
      original English version will prevail. <br>&nbsp;
    </p>
<p>
      9. TERMINATION
    </p>
<p>
      You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
      <br>as expressly provided for under this License.&nbsp; Any other attempt
      to <br>copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and
      will <br>automatically terminate your rights under this License.&nbsp;
      However, <br>parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
      this <br>License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
      <br>parties remain in full compliance. <br>&nbsp;
    </p>
<p>
      10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE
    </p>
<p>
      The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions <br>of the
      GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.&nbsp; Such new <br>versions
      will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may <br>differ in
      detail to address new problems or concerns.&nbsp; See <br>http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.
    </p>
<p>
      Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
      <br>If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
      <br>License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
      <br>following the terms and conditions either of that specified version
      or <br>of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by
      the <br>Free Software Foundation.&nbsp; If the Document does not specify
      a version <br>number of this License, you may choose any version ever
      published (not <br>as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. <br>&nbsp;
    </p>

    </p>
<p>
      If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant Sections"
      <br>instead of saying which ones are invariant.&nbsp; If you have no
      <br>Front-Cover Texts, write "no Front-Cover Texts" instead of <br>"Front-Cover
      Texts being LIST"; likewise for Back-Cover Texts.
    </p>
<p>
      If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we <br>recommend
      releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of <br>free
      software license, such as the GNU General Public License, <br>to permit
      their use in free software.

      태극기 太極旗 the national flag of Korea, the Tai-geuk flag <br>The Korean flag
      is called T\ae{gukgi. It's design symbolizes <br>the principles of yin
      and yang in Oriental philosophy. <br>The circle in the center of the flag
      is divided into two equal <br>parts. The upper red section represents the
      positive cosmic forces of <br>yang. Conversely, the lower blue section
      represents the negative <br>cosmic forces of yin.
    </p>
<p>
      The two forces together embody the concepts of continual <br>movement and
      balance and harmony that characterize the sphere <br>of infinity. The
      circle is surrounded by four trigrams in each <br>corner. Each trigram
      symbolizes one of the four universal elements: <br>heaven, earth, fire,
      and water.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our sites at:
https://gutenberg.org or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext03 or
ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03

Or /etext02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2001 as we release over 50 new eBook
files per month, or 500 more eBooks in 2000 for a total of 4000+
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
should reach over 300 billion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion eBook
Files by December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

At our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third
of that goal by the end of 2001, or about 4,000 eBooks.  We need
funding, as well as continued efforts by volunteers, to maintain
or increase our production and reach our goals.

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created
to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.

As of February, 2002, contributions are being solicited from people
and organizations in: Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Connecticut,
Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois,
Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts,
Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New
Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio,
Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South
Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West
Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.

We have filed in all 50 states now, but these are the only ones
that have responded.

As the requirements for other states are met, additions to this list
will be made and fund raising will begin in the additional states.
Please feel free to ask to check the status of your state.

In answer to various questions we have received on this:

We are constantly working on finishing the paperwork to legally
request donations in all 50 states.  If your state is not listed and
you would like to know if we have added it since the list you have,
just ask.

While we cannot solicit donations from people in states where we are
not yet registered, we know of no prohibition against accepting
donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to
donate.

International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about
how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made
deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are
ways.

Donations by check or money order may be sent to:

Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
PMB 113
1739 University Ave.
Oxford, MS 38655-4109

Contact us if you want to arrange for a wire transfer or payment
method other than by check or money order.

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been approved by
the US Internal Revenue Service as a 501(c)(3) organization with EIN
[Employee Identification Number] 64-622154.  Donations are
tax-deductible to the maximum extent permitted by law.  As fund-raising
requirements for other states are met, additions to this list will be
made and fund-raising will begin in the additional states.

We need your donations more than ever!

Updated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

license, especially commercial redistribution.

<div class="agate">PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</div>

<div>
To protect the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg”), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg™ License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.
</div>

<div class="secthead">
Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div>

<div>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div>
1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div>This particular work is one of the few individual works protected
by copyright law in the United States and most of the remainder of the
world, included in the Project Gutenberg collection with the
permission of the copyright holder. Information on the copyright owner
for this particular work and the terms of use imposed by the copyright
holder on this work are set forth at the beginning of this work.</div>
    
<div>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div>

<div>
1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg™
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.
</div>

<div>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg™ License.
</div>

<div>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<ul>
    <li>• You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    </li>

    <li>• You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    </li>

    <li>• You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </li>

    <li>• You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.
    </li>
</ul>

<div>
1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.
</div>

<div>
1.F.
</div>

<div>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div>

<div class="secthead">
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div>

<div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.
</div>

<div class="secthead">
Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div>
The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.
</div>

<div>
The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact
</div>

<div class="secthead">
Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate
</div>

<div class="secthead">
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div>

<div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

<div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
